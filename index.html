         <P>I've loved Erykah Badu and her music since I first saw her video for her breakout single "On & On" in 1997. More than 25 years later, her music still resonates on a cosmic level in my life. In case you don't know who she is, here's a brief bio on Ms. E. Badu! </P>
         <p style ="text-align: center;"
         > Erica Abi Wright, known professionally as Erykah Badu, is an American singer-songwriter, record producer and actress. Influenced by R&B, soul, and hip hop,[3] Badu rose to prominence in the late 1990s when her debut album Baduizm (1997), placed her at the forefront of the neo soul movement, earning her the honorific nickname "Queen of Neo Soul" by music critics. </p>

         <P>I planned on attending the concert with my brother and his best friend. It would be their second time seeing Erykah live and my fifth time. We were all excited to be traveling to Louiseville for the first time. We were even more excited because the concert was happening at the same time as the Kentucky Derby!</P>

         <p>Though Erykah was the headliner, she was sharing the night with two heavy hitters in the music industry: Bilal and Common. I actually got to see Common in the flesh when I stepped into the lobby to head outside for a smoke. I didn't know that was a sign of what was in store for me later that night. </p>

         <h2>IS THIS A CONCERT OR A RODEO?</h2>
         <p>As newbies to Louisvelle, we were very unware that the concert venue was also a space where they hosted rodeos and other livestock events. It was both bittersweet and hilarious as we waited in a long line that crosssed the entrance to the stables. The smell of manure and animals was in the air for sure to put it kindly. Fortunately the line didn't move too slow and we entered the concert hall of the building to a wonderful set-up. </p>

         <h2>IM AN ARTIST AND IM SENSITIVE ABOUT MY SHHHHHHH.....</h2>
         <p class ="funParagraph">The concert was wonderful. We ended up accidentally sitting in the wrong seats and thought we were about to get escorted further back when the usher arrived. He immediately told us we were supposed to be much closer to the stage. The sound was much better in our actual seats and we could see the performers so much more clearly too. Bilal was fantastic! Common was amazing. Anthony Hamilton came out as a suprise guest too. Then Erykah hit the stage and did her thing as usual. I will say having seen her several times before I was expectign a very upbeat setlist. She kept it pretty chill, which was a nice way to wrap up that day and concert. What happens after the show ends is where this story gets good. I always tell people that had one of the following things not occured, I would have never met my favorite musican. We had to wait almost an hour for an uber to arrive. We decided to have the uber drop us off at the White Castle near the hotel, instead of going to the hotel to change first then grab food. White Castle was HELLA BUSY with the post concert crowd, but the staff was cordial and very patient. It was quite honestly  the best experience I've had at a White Castle. I ordered some donuts to hold me over until the food was ready since I knew it would take a while with the large crowd. I also wanted to have somethign to snack on for the walk back to the hotel. We sat, we ate, we left and to ok our time wakling bak to the hotel. When we arrived, my brother gasped. I assumed he forgot his phone at White Castle, or was upset that he didn't get more food for the rest of the night. He actually saw Erykah before his best friend or I did. I turned around and there was nothing I could do but stare at her. In the lobby, wrapped in a shawl, taking pictures with fans was Erykah Badu. It turns out she was staying in the same hotel as us, which never crossed my mind even after seeing Common in the lobby. My brother worked up ther courage to ask her for a pic, since I was too starstruck to even move. Erykah has a great sense of humor and immediately said "Of course. Yall better hurry up though its late." Again I was starstruck and fumbling with my phone to get the camera app open and the angels right. She offered to take the selfie for us and stood in the middle and effortlessly snapped 5 pics. It wasn't until we all looked at the pictures later that night that we realized I had donut powder on my mouth. Thats the whole point of my story. I met my favorite artist and I had food all over my face. But I wouldn't be me if I didn't do something so silly. I also wouldn't change a thing about that night other than getting more donuts!  </p>

         <p style ="text-align: center;"> Notice that powder donut residue on my lip? I hope Erykah didnt! </p>

      </article> <p style ="text-align: center;"> We ran into Anthony Hamilton after meeting Erykah. He was literally stepping off the elevator we were waiting for and said "Don't start that it's a thousand o'clock in the morning" when he saw our shocked faces. We didn't even have to ask for a pic, he beat us to it and my brothers best friend quickly hoped in the frame. </p>
